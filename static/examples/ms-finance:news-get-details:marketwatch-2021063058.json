The Englewood, Colo.-based company is selling its Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, service areas and its Chicago, Evansville, Indiana, and Anne Arundel, Maryland, service areas for $1.125 billion and $661 million, respectively. The former will be acquired by Atlantic Broadband, a unit of Cogeco Communications Inc., while the latter will be acquired by Astround Broadband. \"The divestiture of these markets will enable us to reduce our debt as we continue to execute our broadband-first strategy, including pursuing our Edge-out and greenfield strategies and expanding our commercial services,\" Wow CEO Teresa Elder said in a statement. The two deals will reduce the company's leverage ratio to 2.5 times, down from 5.0 times as of March 31. The transactions are expected to close in the second half.
