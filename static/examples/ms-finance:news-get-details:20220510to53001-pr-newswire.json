Specific forward-looking statements in this news release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected future generation capacity, production, completion date, community benefits, job creation and tax revenue with respect to the Deerfield II wind project. These statements are based on factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including assumptions based on historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments. Since forward-looking statements relate to future events and conditions, by their very nature they require making assumptions and involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that although it is believed that the assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances, these risks and uncertainties give rise to the possibility that actual results may differ materially from the expectations set out in the forward-looking statements. Material risk factors include those set out in Algonquin's Management Discussion & Analysis and Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2021, each of which is available on SEDAR and EDGAR. Given these risks, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of their dates.
