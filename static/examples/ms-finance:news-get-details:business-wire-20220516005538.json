Forward looking statements may generally be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “plan,”, “project,” “forecast,” “predict,” “potential,” “seem,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” “target” or other similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, Allego’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the business combination. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially, and potentially adversely, from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside Allego’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) changes adversely affecting Allego’s business, (ii) the risks associated with vulnerability to industry downturns and regional or national downturns, (iii) fluctuations in Allego’s revenue and operating results, (iv) unfavorable conditions or further disruptions in the capital and credit markets, (v) Allego’s ability to generate cash, service indebtedness and incur additional indebtedness, (vi) competition from existing and new competitors, (vii) the growth of the electric vehicle market, (viii) Allego’s ability to integrate any businesses it may acquire, (ix) Allego’s ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel, (x) risks related to legal proceedings or claims, including liability claims, (xi) Allego’s dependence on third-party contractors to provide various services, (xii) Allego’s ability to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms, (xiii) the impact of COVID-19, including COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions and expense increases, (xiv) general economic or political conditions, including the armed conflict in Ukraine and (xv) other factors detailed under the section entitled “Item 3.D. Risk Factors” of Allego’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021 and in Allego’s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC.”) The foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. If any of these risks materialize or Allego’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Allego presently does not know or that Allego currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Allego’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this Press Release. Allego anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Allego’s assessments to change. However, while Allego may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Allego specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, unless required by applicable law. These forward looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Allego’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this Press Release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\n","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"p","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"\n","gated":false},{"type":"b","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"FINANCIAL INFORMATION; NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"text","content":"\n","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"p","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this Press Release, such as EBITDA, Operational EBITDA and free cash flow, have not been prepared in accordance with Dutch generally accepted accounting principles, United States generally accepted accounting principles or the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). We define (i) EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization,(ii) Operational EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted for reorganization costs, certain business optimization costs, lease buyouts, anticipated board compensation costs and director and officer insurance costs and anticipated transaction costs and (iii) free cash flow as net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Allego believes that the use of these non-IFRS measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Allego’s financial condition and results of operations. Allego’s management uses these non-IFRS measures for trend analyses, for purposes of determining management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. Allego believes that the use of these non-IFRS financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating projected operating results and trends and in comparing Allego’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-IFRS financial measures to investors. Management does not consider these non-IFRS measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS. The principal limitation of these non-IFRS financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by IFRS to be recorded in Allego’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-IFRS financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-IFRS financial measures in connection with IFRS results and reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS measure are provided in this press release.\n","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"p","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"\n","gated":false},{"type":"sup","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"1","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"text","content":" Utilization rate, a key performance measure, is referenced for ultra-fast chargers.\n","gated":false},{"type":"br","gated":false},{"type":"sup","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"2","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"text","content":" Source: European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA)\n","gated":false},{"type":"br","gated":false},{"type":"sup","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"3","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"text","content":" ","gated":false},{"type":"a","href":"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.allego.eu%2Fevents-publications%2Fpress-releases%2Fdetail%2F22%2Fallego-a-leading-pan-european-ev-fast-charging-network&esheet=52720745&newsitemid=20220516005538&lan=en-US&anchor=Allego%2C+a+Leading+Pan-European+EV+Fast+Charging+Network%2C+Sees+Strong+Momentum+in+Early+First+Quarter+of+2022&index=7&md5=5fe52b49d767b7d864c1bbd09704cf6e","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"Allego, a Leading Pan-European EV Fast Charging Network, Sees Strong Momentum in Early First Quarter of 2022","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"text","content":"\n","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"p","contentObject":[{"type":"img","src":"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20220516005538r1&sid=mstr3&distro=nx&lang=en","alt":"","variations":[],"gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"p","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"\n","gated":false},{"type":"b","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"For Allego \n","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"br","gated":false},{"type":"text","content":"Investors\n","gated":false},{"type":"br","gated":false},{"type":"a","href":"mailto:investors@allego.eu","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"investors@allego.eu \n","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"br","gated":false},{"type":"text","content":"Media\n","gated":false},{"type":"br","gated":false},{"type":"a","href":"mailto:allegoPR@icrinc.com","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"allegoPR@icrinc.com","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"text","content":"\n","gated":false}],"gated":false},{"type":"p","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"View source version on businesswire.com: ","gated":false},{"type":"a","href":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220516005538/en/","contentObject":[{"type":"text","content":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220516005538/en/","gated":false}],"gated":false}],"gated":false}]}
