The Phase 1/2 study assessed antibody levels between seven to eight months after participants had been fully vaccinated with the company's shots, which are still considered investigational. Valneva's inactivated COVID-19 vaccine has not been authorized or approved anywhere worldwide but is currently under review in the European Union and the U.K. The company is also testing its booster in a separate Phase 3 clinical trial and is planning to conduct a \"heterologous booster trial,\" starting early next year. Valneva's stock has soared 108.4% over the last three months, while the S&P 500  has gained 5.1%.
