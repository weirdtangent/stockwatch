Revenue rose to $4.264 billion from $3.732 billion, also ahead of the $3.929 billion FactSet consensus. \"Our business accelerated during Q3 on broad based strength, and we saw growth in all of our divisions, with acceleration in traffic and ticket, growth in digitally-enabled sales and conventional sales, all underpinned by strong membership statistics in both new and tenured members,\" Chief Executive Bob Eddy said in a statement. Same-store sales rose 13.1% to beat the FactSet consensus for a 1.7% decline. The company said it is not offering guidance because of external factors and uncertainties in the market.
