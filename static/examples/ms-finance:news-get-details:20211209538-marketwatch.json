(HCP) started its public life with a 1.5% gain Thursday, on an otherwise downbeat day for Wall Street, after the San Francisco-based cloud adoption software company's initial public offering priced well above its expected range. The IPO priced late Wednesday at $80 a share, above previous projections of a pricing between $68 and $72 a share, as the company raised $1.22 billion. The Class A shares' first trade on the Nasdaq was at $81.16 at 12:00 p.m. Eastern for 2.6 million shares. With a total of about 178.9 million shares (178,895,570) outstanding after the IPO, the first trade price valued the company at about $14.52 billion. The company's upbeat debut comes on a relatively rough day for recently IPO'd stocks, as the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) dropped 2.6% in midday trading while the S&P 500  slipped 0.3%.
