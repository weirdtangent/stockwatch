Every time a different environment is added, engineers may be driven to forgo observability best practices in order to meet strict project timelines. Often, their only alternative is to spend extra planning and development effort to get the right monitoring in place, which can delay project timelines. Teams have blind spots across different tools, making it harder to maintain application uptime and reliability.
